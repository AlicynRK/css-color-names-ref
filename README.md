# css-color-names-ref
A quick reference of CSS color names, sorted by color and hue.

### Made By: Alicyn Knapp, an I Love Hue game enjoyer

### Made Because: I couldn't find a reference for the CSS color names online that sorted the colors by hue. 

The color swatches in the CSS file are sorted by hue, at least according to my perception. However, they are not necessarily sorted by darkest to lightest or vice versa. I sorted these colors using the color swatch previews that popped up in VSCode. The white swatches are sorted by their undertones based on what I could see when hovering over their color box in VSCode, looking at their color gradient/selection box, and identifying the main color used to create that shade of white. I do not claim to be so good at sorting colors that I can sort shades of white.

The classes in the CSS file should **NOT** be used in any capacity for the typical CSS class usage; it was just a convenient way to group the colors.

I have not applied any color theory to this, so feel free to reorder this list as you see fit. Perception of color is subjective, but I promise I'm not colorblind (I've tested it; I'm not).
